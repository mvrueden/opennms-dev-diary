Sometimes it is quite hard to remember all the nits and problems me or others encountered while developing, when looking at a certain implementation a couple of months or even years later.
We all can agree, that it must be a reason for a certain path, but usually notes taken are either lost, or not searchable (no manual `ctrl + f` implementation yet).

Therefore I am going to try another approach and see if documenting my work on a regular basis can help fill that gap if the need arises.
I am very inspired by the Factorio's Friday Facts which publish development details every week to give an inside.  

However, this is a test balloon to see if it helps me to make development better, maybe even more transparent to users and in the end even help remember why a certain path was followed.
