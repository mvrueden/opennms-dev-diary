I always find myself wondering which Horizon Version a Meridian release is based on.
To solve this problem once and for all, I looked them all up by looking at the pom.xml of each `foundation*` branch.

#### Which Horizon Version is Meridian based on?

|=======
|Meridian | Horizon | Branch
|M2015  
|H14
|foundation

|M2016
|H17
|foundation-2016

|M2017
|H19
|foundation-2017

|M2018
|H21
|foundation-2018

|M2019
|TBA, most likely H24
|foundation-2019 (not yet available)
