In the very past OpenNMS was mostly driven by Jetty and Spring*.
Probably a more flexible solution needed to be found, as with a big application like OpenNMS dependency issues are always present.
For example dependency A requires dependency B in Version 1, but dependency C requires the same dependency B in Version 2.
Modern containers - such as Apache Karaf (an OSGi container) - can solve these problems.
Besides that OSGi offers a nice API and Implementation differentiation.
So there was the time, Apache Karaf was introduced.

The main problem was how to integrate it with the current Jetty and Daemon Lifecycle.
By default Karaf has the capability to run web applications, but that is not really working with Spring especially in context with our Daemon lifecycle.
Instead of integrating the daemons and the web application into Karaf itself, another approach was taken: 

Jetty is running as the main container, starting the Karaf Container at some point in its link:https://github.com/opennms/opennms/blob/45618715faaf892a44e9b2ba7fa9f36daf734840/container/servlet/src/main/java/org/opennms/container/web/WebAppListener.java[lifecycle].

There are basically two major problems with this approach:
 
 1. A lot of classes are already known by jetty through its class path (lib directory) and must now be made available to Karaf (due to its class encapsulation mechanisms)
 1. OSGi bundles must consume services, which are defined by Spring
 1. OSGi has already something called `HttpService` to deal with anything `http/web`, e.g. starting a servlet server

For the first problem Karaf provides the concept of a `custom.properties` file. 
This forwards classes known to the JVM running the container to the container itself.
That allowed for new bundles requiring classes already exposed via `${OPENNMS_HOME}/lib` to be just forwarded.

The second problem was solved by a custom link:https://github.com/opennms/opennms/blob/e6dbdc1a9923fcd31beb668f74be140191576e9a/core/soa/src/main/java/org/opennms/core/soa/support/ServiceFactoryBean.java#L51[ServiceRegistry] which just forwards services from the Jetty world to the OSGi service registration.
Again this does not work out of the box, so a custom `onmsgi:service` tag was introduced to spring, in order to make this happen.
The following example shows this in action.
```
 <bean id="dataSource" class="org.opennms.core.db.DataSourceFactoryBean" />
  <onmsgi:service interface="javax.sql.DataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
```

The solution to the third problem was a bit more tricky and dirty.
OSGi defines the service `HttpService` icon:share-square-o[link="https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.html", window="_blank"] to deal with anything web (server) related. This means, Apache Karaf can by default start servlet containers such as tomcat or jetty and thus has their full capabilities.

In order to get the existing OpenNMS architecture integrate with Karaf the "native way" a lot of effort needed to be put into it.
Besides this, OpenNMS was already a running Jetty Server.
A less "work-heavy" solution needed to be found, to bridge the gap between the two worlds and integrate Apache Karaf with OpenNMS (and not the other way around).
That is when a module called `container/bridge` was introduced to expose the running Jetty as an `HttpService` to the underlying Karaf container. 
In order to bend Apache Karaf to their needs everything `http` were modified to not start the http stuff from Karaf.
Back then, the official felix http module was copied over to the link:https://github.com/opennms/opennms/tree/4018b6700d7804a19734201c5f93fca47d63a838/container/bridge/src/main/java/org/opennms/container/web/felix/base/internal[OpenNMS code base] (praise or course the open source gods here).

All of this seemed probably reasonable at that time.
However this approach introduced so many issues.
Some are known to us, and probably some not known to us.

The same is probably true about the Germans.
They also thought flying big cigarettes out of steel filled with very burnable and explosive gas is managable and will not cause any issues.
Thus the name "The Hindenburg Effect"

This is in no way meant to be a blaming, but just a write up of problems we are facing on a regulary basis.
See link:/posts/development/10-karaf-update-4.2.2/[here] for the problems we faced when upgrading Karaf to 4.2.2.
