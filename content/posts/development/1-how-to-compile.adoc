## Prerequirements

In order to compile OpenNMS at least the following requirements should be met:

1. The latest JDK should be installed. (At the moment OpenNMS does not compile with a java version greater than 9, this may change in the future)
1. nsis
1. cloned github opennms repository


## Optional Requirements

1. PostgreSQL server should be available (not for compiling, but for starting afterwards) 
1. Jicmp, jicmp6
1. maven

## Building

OpenNMS uses Maven as a build tool and is split in 2 basic modules:

1. parent/root modules
2. opennms-full-assembly 

Usually when building all mvn goals must be run against those two modules.
In order to make live easier, there are various help scripts available. 

Simplified explanation:

 - clean.pl -> Invokes `mvn clean` and `mvn clean -F opennms-full-assembly`
 - compile.pl -> Compiles the root module (Invokes a `mvn install` on the root module)
 - assemble.pl -> Builds the final assembly (opennms-<version>.tar.gz) (Invokes a `mvn install -F opennms-full-assembly`)

Each script (except clean.pl) requires some arguments in order to configure OpenNMS correctly for later deployment.

## Full build

`cd ~/dev/opennms`
`./clean.pl`
./compile.pl -DskipTests` # Tests should not be executed
`./assemble.pl -DskipTests` # Tests should not be executed, may provide -Dopennms.home if you want to deploy it somewhere else then `~/dev/opennms/target/opennms-<version>`

## How I Build

Regular development
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -U -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -p dir -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```

When Deploying it somewhere else than locally on my machine
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -Dopennms.home=/opt/opennms -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```
