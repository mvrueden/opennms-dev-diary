This article describes how to compile OpenNMS from source.
If you have not set up your environment properly, please see link:/posts/development/0-dev-environment-macos[here].

# Checkout the Code

First of all, the code should be checked out.
I usually do this in my `~/dev` directory:

`git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms.git`

This will create an `opennms` directory in `~/dev/opennms`.
Next cd into it: `cd opennms`.

# Build from Source

## TL;DR

Regular development
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -U -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -p dir -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```

When Deploying it somewhere else than locally on my machine
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -Dopennms.home=/opt/opennms -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```

## Detailled explanation

The build of OpenNMS is usually split into 3 phases: 
 
 - clean.pl -> Removes all previously build artifacts/archives 
 - compile.pl -> Compiles the root module
 - assemble.pl -> Builds the final assembly `opennms-<version>.tar.gz` 

Behind the scenes OpenNMS uses link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven] as a build tool.
The above scripts roughly translate to the following actions:

 - clean.pl -> invokes `mvn clean` and `mvn clean -F opennms-full-assembly`
 - compile.pl -> invokes a `mvn install` on the root module
 - assemble.pl -> invokes a `mvn install -F opennms-full-assembly`

Each script has various numbers of arguments and options, which you can show with `-h`

### Full build (step by step)

First navigate to your local git repository

`cd ~/dev/opennms`

Ensure you are on the desired branch (e.g. develop)

`git status` 

Now do a full build with the following command

```
./clean.pl && ./comppile.pl -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -DskipTests -p dir
```

This will build OpenNMS from source (no tests are executed) and will place all files and directories to `~/dev/opennms/target/opennms-<current-version>`.

If you want an archive instead, simply omit the `-p dir` option

If you want another `opennms.home` directory, simply define it in the assembly step: `./assemble.pl -DskipTests -Dopennms.home=/opt/opennms -p dir`.

icon:exclamation-triangle[] Please keep in mind, that if you are building the first time, this may take several hours, because a lot of dependencies must be downloaded.

## Running OpenNMS after compilation

After OpenNMS built from Source successfully it must be configured before it can be started.

First configure java:

`./bin/runjava -s` 

and afterwards initialize/update the database:

`sudo ./bin/install -dis`

Pro Tip:
In case you are working on an OSGi bundle it is recommend to link the root user's `.m2/repository` directory to the user you build OpenNMS with.
This enables you to use the `bundle:watch` command or manually install missing bundles, which are not located in the `system` directory. 

```
> sudo su
> mkdir ~/.m2
> cd ~/.m2
> ln -s /home/<user>/.m2/repository repository
```

Now OpenNMS can be started (i.e. with the -t option to enable the remote debugger):

```
sudo ./bin/opennms -vt start
```

The WEB UI should come up after some time at `http://localhost:8980/opennms`.

### How I Build

Regular development
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -U -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -p dir -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```

When deploying it to a custom `opennms.home` (i.e. on another machine)
```
time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -Dopennms.home=/opt/opennms -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a dependency download or OpenNMS Maven Repositor issue, try rebuilding at least twice before considering it an actual issue.
Sometimes it requires multiple runs before it actually works.
This will be solved as soon as the maven repository is populated properly

## Running Tests

There will be a topic talking about running the various tests locally.
As a general side note however
*NEVER run ALL unit or integration tests locally.
This is what Bamboo is for.*
