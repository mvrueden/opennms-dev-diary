Here we cover what is necessary to build OpenNMS from Source and afterwards start it locally on your Mac OS system.

# Compile Prerequisites

In order to compile OpenNMS at least the following requirements should be met:

1. The latest JDK 8 version should be installed
1. makensis
1. cloned github OpenNMS repository
1. maven (optional)

# Run Prerequisites

1. PostgreSQL server
1. Jicmp, jicmp6 (both optional)

# Satisfy compile Prerequisites

## Install git

Git is required to interact with the OpenNMS' source code repository hosted on link:https://github.com/openNMS/opennms[GitHub].

The easiest way to install `git`, is to just type in `git` in the terminal.
MacOS asks you to install `XCode Command Line Tools`

However as we need other dependencies as well, I'd recommend installing homebrew instead.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

See https://brew.sh/index_de for more details.

This will also install the XCode command line tools and therefore git as well.

Afterwards verify with `git` that it actually works:

```
> git --version
git version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)
```

## Install JDK 8

As of writing this article only JDK 8 is supported to build from source. I personally use Oracle JDK 8, but you can also use OpenJDK if you like.

Download Oracle JDK 8 for MacOS from link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
[here].

After Installation verify that java has been correclty installed:

```
> java -version
java version "1.8.0_211"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_211-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.211-b12, mixed mode)
```

## Windows Installer (Makensis)

When building OpenNMS from source also a windows installer is compiled. In order to do this successfully you can either install the according packages via `brew`:

`brew install makensis`

If you are not interested in the Windows Installer bits, you can also simply use a `nsis.sh` script which simply exists with `0` and put it on your path.

Afterwards ensure `makensis` can be invoked from your path:

```
> makensis
Usage:
  makensis [ option | script.nsi | - ] [...]
```

## Maven (optional)

I personally like to use `mvn` commands instead of `./compile.pl`, `./clean.pl` or `./assemble.pl` in certain cases, therefore maven should also be installed.

`brew install maven`

Simply verify afterwards:

```
> mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.1 (d66c9c0b3152b2e69ee9bac180bb8fcc8e6af555; 2019-04-04T21:00:29+02:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.1/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_211, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_211.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_DE, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.14.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

The version is not that important, but should be anything greater 3.5.2 (as of writing this article)


# Satisfy build prerequisites

## JICMP and JICMP 6

`brew install automake`
`brew install autogen`

### JICMP

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/jicmp.git
cd jicmp
git submodule update --init --recursive
autoreconf -fvi
./configure
make
```

### JICMP 6

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/jicmp6.git
cd jicmp6
git submodule update --init --recursive
autoreconf -fvi
./configure
make
```

## Postgres

OpenNMS requires a Postgres installation to run.
I personally use the `Postgres.app` for MacOS.
Simply download it from link:https://postgresapp.com/de/downloads.html[here] and copy it to your Applications folder.


# Fazit

Now everything should be set up to build OpenNMS from source and afterwards run it from the command line.
In the article link:/posts/development/1-how-to-compile[How to Compile from Source] all the details are covered.
