link:/posts/development/4-connect-to-karaf-shell[Here] I explained on how to connect to the OpenNMS Karaf Shell.
However when connecting to Sentinel or Minion the ports are different.

The following table shows the default ports for each system

|=======
|System     | Port
|OpenNMS    | 8101
|Minion     | 8201
|Sentinel   | 8301
