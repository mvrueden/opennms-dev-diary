One user in the community is using the GraphML Topology and asked me in chat if it were possible to add tooltips to a vertex from within a groovy script.
Short answer: Yes

Long answer:

By default, setting the tooltip is supposed to work only by setting it directly in the graphml file itself.
The link:https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/branches/develop/guide-development/guide-development.html#_supported_attributes[official documentation] for this says, that the name of the attribute is `tooltipText`. 
So if you are looking for static tooltips, that is the way to go.

By default dynamic tooltips are not supported, but we could leverage the `GraphMLVertexStatusProvider` capabilities.
Simply enable it and add the following line to the file `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/graphml-vertex-status/default.groovy`:

{{<highlight groovy>}}
import org.opennms.features.topology.plugins.topo.graphml.GraphMLVertexStatus

assert alarmSummary != null

vertex.setTooltipText("test"); // :)

return new GraphMLVertexStatus() \
    .severity(alarmSummary.maxSeverity)
    .alarmCount(alarmSummary.alarmCount)
{{</highlight>}}

That is pretty much it.

For more properties, simply have a look at the classes

Any `public` method can be used in the groovy script.
