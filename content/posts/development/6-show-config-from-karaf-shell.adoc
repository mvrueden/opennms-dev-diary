Sometimes it is required to show a (bundle) configuration from the Karaf Shell.
This may be on OpenNMS, Minion or Sentinel.

First of all a connection to the Karaf Shell must be made.
link:/posts/development/4-connect-to-karaf-shell[Here] is described on how to do this.
The according ports can be found link:/posts/development/7-default-ssh-ports[here].

Now let's assume we want to see the current values of the id, location and other settings on Minion.
First of all we need to know in which cfg file the property is located.

For this

```
config:list
```

prints all configuration files with its configuration properties.

To filter for one config file, the following will do:

```
config:list "(service.pid=<config-pid>)"
```

So to show the config file for Minion id, location and such, the following command will do that for you

```
config:list "(service.pid=org.opennms.minion.controller)"
```

Please note, that this will only show actual configuration and no default values.
