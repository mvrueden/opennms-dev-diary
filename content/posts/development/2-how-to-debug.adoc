Sometimes it is required to debug against a running OpenNMS, or debug a test.
No matter what I debug, when it comes to OpenNMS I (almost) always use Java Remote Debugging.
This allows a Remote Debugger (e.g. eclipse or IntelliJ) to connect to the running Java application and debug the application.

Before you can debug OpenNMS you need to load the project into your IDE.
As I am using IntelliJ, this is what I am going to cover in this article.
See link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/IDEA_and_OpenNMS[IDEA and OpenNMS].

1. Set a breakpoint in the IDE.
2. Setup "Remote Debugging" for your IDE (see below for IntelliJ example)
3. Run the application in remote debug mode
4. Connect the Debugger

## Breakpoints

## Setup Remote Debugger


## Run the Application in Remote Debug Mode

For OpenNMS this is pretty straight forward: `$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/opennms -t start`.
This will open a port on 8001 for a remote debugger to connect to.

When debuggin tests, you have to run the test and tell maven to open a debugger port.
For smoke-tests this looks something like this: `mvn clean verify -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=<testName> -Dmaven.failsafe.debug`
For integration/unit-tests this looks like this: `mvn clean test -Dtest=<testName> -Dmaven.surefire.debug`
In both cases mvn opens a port on 5005 to connect the remote debugger to.

# Connect the Debugger
Usually hit the "Run" button for the "Remote Debugger Configuration" from your IDE. 
See chapter "Setup Remote Debugger".
