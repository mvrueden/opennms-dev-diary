I thought with all the issues I already fixed, now everything should work again.

NOPE.

Bamboo is telling me that `NxosTelemetryIT` is no longer working.
Okay, that is easy to reproduce with link:https://github.com/mvrueden/scripts/blob/master/opennms/system-tests.sh[my system-test.sh] script, inspired by some version from Jesse White.

Running the script with the Bamboo URL to the build, e.g.

```
/system-tests.sh https://bamboo.opennms.org/browse/OPENNMS-ONMS2773-14
```

as an argument will download the RPMs and build the same docker images as Bamboo would.

Afterwards I can run the failing smoke test

```
mvn clean verify -Dorg.opennms.smoketest.docker=true -Dsmoke=true -Dorg.opennms.smoketest.docker.skipTearDown=true -Dorg.opennms.smoketest.docker.useExisting=false -Dorg.opennms.smoketest.webdriver.use-chrome -D"chrome.path=/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=NxosTelemetryIT -Dorg.opennms.advertised-host-address=192.168.1.16
```

Setting `skipTearDown=true` keeps the Docker Container after the tests ran and allows me to debug into them.

Logging in to the Minion reveals that the `UdpListener` is not started as it should.

Playing around with the `config:edit` command revealed, that Karaf is not detecting the changes made there by the `ListenerManager` wich implemetns a `ManagedServiceFactory`.

I eventually ended up creating issue link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-6181[KARAF-6181] just to find out later, that the usage of the command `config:edit` in combination with a `ManagedServiceFactory` has changed.

Instead of using

```
config:edit <pid>-<alias>
```

```
config:edit --factory <pid> --alias <alias>
```

should be used.

And yet another issue solved \o/
