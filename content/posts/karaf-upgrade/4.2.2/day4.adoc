link:/posts/karaf-upgrade/4.2.2/day3[Yesterday] I learned, that the `pax-whiteboard` bundle is no longer starting.
Investigating the issue some further revealed, that when activating the bundle an Exception `java.lang.IllegalStateException: HttpService must be implementing Pax-Web WebContainer!` is thrown. 
This is a known issue (with OpenNMS), but before Karaf 4.2.2 it just worked.
My guess is, that the Exception was triggered AFTER the bundle was started. 
However now this happens when the bundle is still starting and therefore failing. 

This may not sound like a lot, but it took me the whole day to figure this out.
Here is my comment from the OpenNMS Dev Channel about it (mvrueden, 19th of Februrary 2019, 19:46 CET):

  The main problem here is, that when the whiteboard pattern bundle is started, the Activator bails with an exception which stopps the bundle. 
  This behaviour differs from our current state. 
  The reason may be a new implementation in Bundle Activators in Karaf 4.2.2 or in preperation to make it more OSGI 7 compatible. 
  Or may be a change in the new pax-web code (which also changed). 
  I have to dive in deeper to find a solution. Probably use Felix instead of pax
