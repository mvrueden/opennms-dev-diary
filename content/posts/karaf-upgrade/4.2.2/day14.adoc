Yesterday we encountered the issue, that the docker image build by Bamboo was not able to run on the agent itself, but locally did.
As with docker this should not happen, so we have to investigate.

It turns out, that some of our JAXB dependencies we put into `${karaf.home}/lib` fail while loading.
Simply link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/pull/2380/commits/ef5f0ad955bb1104abc864e29b623f3c9238fdb9[removing] them link:https://bamboo.opennms.org/browse/OPENNMS-ONMS2773-18[solved] at least the Smoke Test failures.

The last test failing, is probably a flapper.

So in the end "Alles wird gut" turns out to be true.
