Yesterday we spend all day fiddling with our `KarafTestCases` and finally disabled them.
Today I thought we were going to fix some of our failed Smoke Tests, but instead we are going to do something different.

Looking at the docker containers build for our System Tests, I encountered the following exception in the karaf.log.

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not supported: 
http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD
```

Consulting the Oracle pointed me to a topic on the link:http://karaf.922171.n3.nabble.com/Error-opening-blueprint-xml-url-quot-when-deploying-blueprint-file-on-custom-distribution-Karaf-4-2--td4054957.html#a4054993[Karaf Mailing List].
There it states, that the problem is fixed in Apache Karaf 4.2.3

```
Hi, 

Yes, it's fixed on the coming 4.2.3 release. 

I plan to submit Karaf 4.2.3 to vote this week. 

If you can't wait, you can use 4.2.3-SNAPSHOT. I won't be easy on 4.2.2 
because it's a fix on the code (not configuration). 

If you are really on a rush, please ping me directly, I can provide 
"custom" patched version of jar. 

Regards 
JB

When starting the Karaf Upgrade `4.2.3` was still in Development and not yet released.

Luckily, Updating Karaf takes a lot of time and effort, so Karaf `4.2.3` was already released \o/

So the rest of the day I spend upgrading from `4.2.2` to `4.2.3`

As a result I also created an "How to Upgrade Karaf" icon:share-square-o[link="https://opennms.discourse.group/t/how-to-upgrade-apache-karaf/259", window="_blank"] topic in our Discourse.

After Updating to `4.2.3` the original Exception was gone, but now I could no longer log into the Karaf Shell.
There are several reasons for this:

- I changed the default ssh role from `admin` to `ssh` but forgot to populate that change to the `users.properties` as well (true for all containers)
- We implement a custom `LoginModule` which inherits from `AbstractKarafLoginModule`. In Karaf 4.2.3 there is now a different implementation/Behaviour expected, which we did not implement. Applying link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/commit/88a60dcbbfc2d5cf74db1cf09722e083955607e1[this patch] solved that issue as well.

Again I pushed my changes and will see what else is broken.
