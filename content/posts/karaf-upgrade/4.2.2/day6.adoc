link:/posts/karaf-upgrade/4.2.2/day5[Yesterday] we started to to replace our custom Http Bridge with the official Http Felix Bridge.
I started implementing a `ProxyFilter` to dispatch all requests to the OSGi world if it can be handled by any OSGi registered service to make `/opennms/topology` work instead of using `/opennms/osgi/topology`. 
While finalizing this initial work, I encountered a problem that service properties supported by the `PAX WEB` project are not officially supported by OSGi and with that not supported by the `Apache Felix HTTP` project.

Looking at the OSGi Http Specification revealed, that the property should be called `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern` instead.

That doesn't sound too bad.

Simply replace all service properties `alias` with `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern`, rebuild and let's see the result, by verifying the Topology Map, as most of our OSGi servlet services are Vaadin Servlets.

But the Topology Map showed a 404. 

Can't things just simply work.

Debugging revealed, that the call is actually dispatched properly for the `/opennms/topology` request.

This is good, as it should be dispatched.

However, the OSGi world is determining that it cannot handle the request, thus resulting in a 404.
Debugging the problem, showed that the `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern` is behaving differntly than the `alias` key, as the name suggests. 

So instead of `/topology`, the `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern` should be `/topology/*` in order to handle Topology Map related calls properly. 

In order to make this work properly, I had to also adjust the `ProxyFilter` to encounter for wildcards in the pattern.
This also affected the `Pax Vaadin` components (we forked), but was simply to fix.

After some tweaks, it finally worked.

Okay kinda (-:

Beside this, all OSGi ReST requests were also working, such as `/rest/classifications`.

Yay, at least some progress `\o/`

It seems that somehow Vaadin is not working anymore.
Trying other Vaadin UIs showed the same problem.
But this is a story for another day.
