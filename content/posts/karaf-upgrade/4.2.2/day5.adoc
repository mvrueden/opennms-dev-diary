link:/posts/karaf-upgrade/4.2.2/day4[Yesterday] I found out, that we can no longer use our forked Http Service Bridge.
This is good for once, as we can now finally get rid of it.
But on the other hand this, will be a lot of work.
So let's get started.

## Which version to use

As we can no longer use the `pax-whiteboard` bundle as we used to, we have to find another solution.
I asked the Oracle and found out, that the link:http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-http-service.html[Apache HTTP Felix] project provides a "Bridge Mode" which may solve our issue.

But first I had to find out which version to use. 
I ended up using version link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.felix/org.apache.felix.http.bridge/3.0.0[3.0.0], mainly because it matched the `felixVersion` property we already used in OpenNMS and it supports the `HTTP Whiteboard Pattern`, which is the reason why we have to do this in the first place.

## Back to the Roots

I decided to try out the "Bridge Mode" first in an isolated enviroment in order to better understand how it is supposed to work.
Refering to the documentation it states:

```
Using the Servlet Bridge

The servlet bridge is used if you want to use the HTTP service inside a WAR deployed on a 3rd part applicaiton server. 
A little setup is needed for this to work:

- deploy org.apache.felix.http.proxy jar file inside the web application (WEB-INF/lib); 
- in a startup listener (like ServletContextListener) set the BundleContext as a servlet context attribute (see example);
- define org.apache.felix.http.proxy.ProxyServlet inside your web.xml and register it to serve on all requests /* (see example);
- define org.apache.felix.http.proxy.ProxyListener as a <listener> in your web.xml to allow HTTP session related events to be forwarded (see the section of Servlet API Event forwarding below and example);
- be sure to add javax.servlet;javax.servlet.http;version=2.6 to OSGi system packages (org.osgi.framework.system.packages);
- deploy org.apache.felix.http.bridge (or org.apache.felix.http.bundle) inside the OSGi framework.
```

This doesn't sound too complicated.

Basically we need to forward some HTTP Requests from Jetty to OSGi.
For this we use the `ProxyServlet` and forward it to, e.g. `/osgi`, defined in a `web.xml`. 
The `ProxyListener` is used to forward Session related events.

So I created a new plain maven Webapp project and followed the instructions from above.
This resulted in a Webapp with a `WebAppListener` which starts Apache Karaf at some point during Jetty's startup process.

This resulted in a setup where custom `javax.servlet.Servlet` services could be registered via OSGi and was served by the Jetty.

This looked almost identical to what we have in OpenNMS now.
See link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/c596f65962945f0af47fe82c022dae3b8fdfd9b9/container/servlet[container/servlet] in OpenNMS for more details.

## Apply this to OpenNMS

The integration with OpenNMS was simple.
I just replaced our custom bundle, with the official felix jar in link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/pull/2380/commits/4869f128d34ad17f7d8adcce7080abc3249f1d26[4869f128d34ad17f7d8adcce7080abc3249f1d26].

However I learned pretty quickly why we originally forked the `Apache Felix HTTP Bridge`.
The problem I encountered was, that with the `ProxyServlet` a designated path must be assigned for all OSGi related HTTP Requests, e.g. `/osgi`. 
We have that in place, but block them all in the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/be646765639d9d1928c1b30cff452838199b8285/opennms-webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml#L149[spring-security configuration].
Besides that, some applications are directly accessed without the `/osgi` prefix, like the Topology Map: `/opennms/topology`.
However it should be something like `/opennms/osgi/topology`.
In order to make this work, we created a `ProxyFilter` to dispatch all related requests to OSGi, or handle them via Jetty.
But to implement this reliably, access to the "Http Bridge Code" is required. 
And that is probably the reason why it was forked in the first place.

However, I did not want to follow this path, so I decided to follow a more "OSGi friendly" approach.
I decided to stick with the `ProxyFilter` approach for now.
The goal of the `ProxyFilter` is to dispatch requests to the "OSGi world" if necessary, otherwise follow the Jetty path.
In order to do this, the filter must know which requests the "OSGi world" can process.
As we cannot hook into the `Apache Felix Http Code` anymore, I decided to just listen for all `javax.servlet.Servlet` services.
This allows us to only forward those requests which can be handled by OSGi. 

Besides listening to `javax.servlet.Servlet` it is required to also dispatch all requests to `/rest/classifications`, `/rest/flows`, `rest/datachoices`, as those are also handled by OSGi, but don't have a dedicated `javax.servlet.Servlet` registered. 
The link:https://github.com/opennms/opennms/commit/83c42517d94b47a4c58ef00a434d9ecd75da1f81[first implementation] simply hardcoded those URLs and dispatched if the URL started with those strings.

After doing this, everything should at least somehow work, but it didn't.
Another problem I encountered was, that the `PAX HTTP implementation` seem to use different service properties.
For example all `javax.servlet.Servlet` services were originally registered with an `alias` key to define the servlet path, e.g. `alias=/topology`. 
However, the official OSGi specification define different propeties. 
With that the `Http Apache Felix` service does not support the `alias` service property.
But this is for another day.
