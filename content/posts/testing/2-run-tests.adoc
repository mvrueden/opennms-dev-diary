While developing in OpenNMS at some point our Continous Integration System Bamboo (TODO MVR add link) will build and test the commited code.
Usually that results in Test failures.
So how to debug those tests locally?

First of all, the current branch must be fully build.
`time (./clean.pl && ./compile.pl -U -DskipTests && ./assemble.pl -p dir -DskipTests); say "OpenNMS may be ready for deployment"` (TODO MVR link to How to Compile)

<small>This is a bit tedious, but do not try any shortcuts here, especially if you are switching branches a lot, or do not know what you are doing.</small>

Bamboo will usually tell which test class or test method failed.

Now we have to find the module wher ethis class lives in.
I usually do that by finding it:

`find ~/dev/opennms -iname "<testName>.java"`

Afterwards navigate to the module:

`cd ~/dev/opennms/<module>`

Now we have to distinguish if it is a unit or integration test.
A unit test ends with `Test.java`, whereas an integration test ends with `IT.java`.

## Unit Test

Running a Unit-Test:

`mvn clean test -Dtest=<testName>`

Debugging a Unit Test

`mvn clean test -Dtest=<testName> -Dmaven.surefire.debug` 

This will open a maven remote debugger on Port 5005.
With your IDE of choice you can now remote connect to that port and start debugging.

## Integratin Test

Running an Integration-Test:

`mvn clean verify -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=<testName>

Debuggin an Integration-Test:

`mvn clean verify -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=<testName> -Dmaven.failsafe

When running Integration tests (via the `mvn verify` goal) all unit tests are also executed.
This is especially frustrated, when the unit tests take some time as well as the integration test.
To increase roundtrip time, I tend to just delete the unit tests and fix any potential compile errors.
When the test is fixed, I simply revert the changes using `git checkout -p` or `git checkout -- <file name>`

`find . -iname "*Test.java" -exec rm -f {} \;`
