Sometimes it is required to run a smoke test locally.
A smoke test in OpenNMS is a test running against an actual (not configured, fresh installed) instance of OpenNMS, doing some ui tests.

In order to run a smoke test you either need to build OpenNMS, freshly install it from RPMs or use the OpenNMS smoke-test docker image.


Smoke Test are tests, running ui tests, e.g. <testname>

Either fully build manually, start OpenNMS and run the test

Or build docker images (TODO add my script) and start it, then run the test
