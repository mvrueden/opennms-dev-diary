Naming is hard.
I found myself laying out a basic module structure for the new graph service modules and ended up with the following dilemma:

To distinguish it from the old `topology` module I'd like to name it differently, e.g. `graph`.
However `features/graph` indicates a single thing. 
`features/graphs` on the other hand looks more fitting.
In the end `features/topology` is the best fit.
Maybe I just go with that instead.
