With the POC new implementation we could solve the current problems of the Topology in OpenNMS.

The next step is to take what was learned and implement something similar and more robust in OpenNMS.
 
As this is a big chunk to swallow, the main issue here is on how to split the work into small pieces, 
as with this kind of API you basically have to almost implement everything before it can be used.

The initial implementation will provide all required modules and classes/interfaces to allow implementing a provider, such as `Vmware` and allow using mechanisms like
change detection and persistence. Where these services do not need to be fully implemented.

Must implement

 - API for graph service (Vertex, etc.)
 - API for graph persistence (VertexEntity, PersistenceService, etc.)
 - API for abstract conversion (GenericVertex, etc.) to later on provide those as JSON and XML
 - Simulate de-coupled loading of graph
 - API to search/enrich

Probably implement

 - Default Graph Provider, such as GraphML

May implement later

 - concrete persistence (Graph Database, or Postgres, etc.)
 - concrete graph providers (e.g. vmware, etc.)
