In OpenNMS we use `Bootstrap 3` as a library to help styling web pages.
However the style sheets are customized in a way, that they are not `bootstrap-compatible` anymore.

As you can see, the custom stylings do not follow the bootstrap "schema", so each component is either not fully provided (e.g. list stylings or panels),
or they are using a different context (The OpenNMS color's indicate the severity context, whereas the bootstrap `\*-info`, `*-warning`, etc. classes indicate a UI context).
To me it always felt, that with the custom styling we originally applied the UI or components looked weird, especially the color combinations.

Besides that, if you were to add `Bootstrap 3` components, they don't look like `Bootstrap 3` or follow their style guidelines (i.e. the panels). 
With that I found myself very often either reverting our custom styling or adjust the result in a way, that it looks modern/nice and provides a somewhat useful result.

The user experience with OpenNMS is not that great in general and I thought wouldn't it be nice to just rely on `Bootstrap 3` and be able to at least use the default components, which in return would increase the user experience.
To implement this, I started ripping out all of our custom stylings and make the UI look "default".
While doing that I really quick realized, that some components which are available in `Bootstrap 4` are missing.
That is when I decided to migrate to `Bootstrap 4`, as it gives more possibilities in general.

For comparison the following image contains the Bootstrap 4 Default Theme.

## Migration
The migration per se was pretty straight forward.

Mainly I followed the official link:https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/[Migration Guide].
In order to not miss anything, a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18cxvSMEBI4LDTTzmrFA_7CCRtSH-OOWoYV_4QCsDk2s[Google Sheet] helped to track the progress.

Besides that the following problems had to be solved:
 * Glyphicons are no longer part of bootstrap. Therefore the support was dropped and now only font-awesome Icons are available.
 * Validation is rewritten, as `has-errors` is no longer available, but `is-invalid` is. Also some inputs are no longer showing visuals, but are replaced with a more unique concept.


Here are some examples of how the ui looks with Bootstrap 4
