I started developing for OpenNMS in the end of 2012.
Now it is the beginning of 2019, and during that time a lot of code from my part was contributed.
For me it is quite hard to remember all the nits and problems me or others encountered while developing, when looking at a certain implementation a couple of months or years later.
Of course I am taking notes, but those are not `ctrl+f` compatible.

Therefore I am going to try another approach and see if documenting my work on a regular basis.
I am very inspired by the Factorio's Friday Facts. 

This is a test balloon to see if it helps me to remember decisions I made better.
